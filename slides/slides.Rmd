# Identifying Statistical Patterns in Educational Inequality

## Available Data
Source: College Scorecard, a federally maintained dataset

Outcome Statistics by Cohort:

* Completion Rates disaggregated by Race (percent)
* Post-Graduation Earnings disaggregated by Household Income Terciles (in dollars)

Explanatory Statistics for each school:

* Type (Public, Non-Profit Private, For-Profit Private) (coded 1, 2, 3)
* Instructional Expenditures per Full-time Student (in dollars)

## Questions Motivating our Approach
Are "outcome gaps" between groups related to the type of school or expenditures?

* Compute gap metrics as percent difference in outcomes

* Conduct hypothesis testing

Are other variables related to outcome gaps?

* Run Random Forest with additional variables for insight on relative importance

# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Completion Rates by Race

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_black_cohort.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_hispanic_cohort.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
 
</div>

*Trend looks generally negative, but with a lot of variance*

## Completion Rates by Race

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_asian_cohort.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  *CSUs have significant completion rate gaps, but UCs and private elites have similar outcome gaps despite differences in expenditures.*
 
</div>

## Earnings Gaps by Household Income

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_high_low_cohort.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_high_mid_cohort.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
 
</div>

*Interestingly, the gap between middle income and high income students seems to worsen with higher expenditures.*

## Earnings Gaps by Household Income

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_mid_low_cohort.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">

*Negative values indicate that low income students actually tend to outperform middle income students*
 
</div>

## Completion Rates: White-Black

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_black.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_black_zoom.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
</div>
 *The data looks fairly random. Possibly a negative trend, but fairly weak-looking.*

## Completion Rates: White-Hispanic

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_hispanic.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_hispanic_zoom.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
</div>

*Similar patterns. It does seem that at higher expenditures, there is less variance in completion gaps.*

## Completion Rates: White-Asian

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_asian.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_completion_white_asian_zoom.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
</div>
*There definitely seem to be differences in means between the three groups, but the distributions are similar.*

## Post Graduation Earnings: High-Low
<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_high_low.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_high_low_zoom.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
</div>
*This correlation for high-low income earnings gaps looks much stronger.*

## Post Graduation Earnings: High-Mid
<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_high_mid.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_high_mid_zoom.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
</div>
*Correlation with high-middle income gaps is less dramatic but still seems to have some negative trend.*

## Post Graduation Earnings: Mid-Low
<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_mid_low.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
  <img src="images/eda_scatterplots/gap_earnings_mid_low_zoom.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="400">
  
</div>
*This pattern seems fairly flat, maybe a slight positive trend.*

# Formal Analysis: ANOVA

## White-Black Completion ANOVA

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/completion_rate_tukeyplot_white_black.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="600">
  
</div>

*Little evidence of significance for the difference in white-black completion rate gap between types of schools.*

## White-Hispanic Completion ANOVA

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/completion_rate_tukeyplot_white_hispanics.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="600">
  
</div>

*Here we see evidence that for-profit schools have significantly different white-hispanic completion gaps.*

## White-Asian Completion ANOVA

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/completion_rate_tukeyplot_white_asian.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="600">
  
</div>

*We see a similar pattern with the white-Asian completion gap difference.*

## High-Low Earnings ANOVA

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/earnings_tukeyplot_high_low.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="600">
  
</div>
*Differences looks more significant here.*

## High-Mid Earnings ANOVA

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/earnings_tukeyplot_high_mid.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="600">
  
</div>
*Less significant in comparison to High-Low.*

## Mid-Low Earnings ANOVA

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/earnings_tukeyplot_mid_low.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="600">
  
</div>
*Differences are less significant. We do see the trends from the past two plots reverse.*

# Formal Analysis: Correlations

## Linear Models
Hypothesis: coefficients regressing outcome gaps on expenditures will be negative

## Completion Rate Gaps

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/completion_gaps_results.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="700">
  
</div>
*Slopes are mostly insignificantly different from zero. Many are positive - Hypothesis rejected*

## Earnings Gaps

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/earnings_gaps_results.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="700">
  
</div>
*Extremely significant negative coefficient for high-low, others less significant.*

# Random Forest Exploration of other Variables

## Overview

Consider relationships and relative importance of other possibly relevant variables, relating to:

* Location
* Student Body Racial Diversity
* Student Body Economic Distribution
* Selectivity
* Type of Degree Awarded

## Performance
Generally performed poorly in terms of proportion of variance explained

</div>

## Completion Rates

<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/rf_importance_completion.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="800">
  
</div>
*INEXPFTE is quite important compared to other terms. Diversity also seems relevant.*

## Completion Rates
<div class="columns-8">

  <img src="images/rf_importance_earnings.png" alt="wb cohort" height="400" width="800">
  
</div>
*INEXPFTE is important again. Economic variables are more important in these models.*



# Conclusions

## Addressing Motivating Questions

* Completion Rate differences across Races did not seem to correspond strongly with type of school or expenditures

* Signficant evidence of Earnings Gaps across economic backgrounds corresponding with expenditures

* No accounting for multiple testing

* Of many possible variables, Random Forest analysis suggests INEXPFTE is more important than others, but CONTROL is unimportant
